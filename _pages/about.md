Scimat concentrates on areas where mathematics and computing are most relevant to each other, emphasizing the bridges between theory and practice. We offer opportunities for potential computer scientists both to develop a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of their subject, and to acquire a familiarity with the mathematics of application areas where computers can solve otherwise intractable problems.

We shall be looking at the applications of mathematics in the fields of machine learning, computational neuroscience, app development, game development, competitive programming and website development.
